###How to use?

1.After activating your theme, you can see a prompt pointed out as absolutely critical. Go to **"Appearance -> Install Plugins"**.
Or, upload the plugin to wordpress, Activate it. (Access the path (/wp-content/plugins/) And upload files there.)

2.Create a new WordPress file or edit an existing one. Just make sure to select this new created template file as the **"Template"** for this page from the **"Attributes"** section. Enter page title like **"Custom One Page"**. Save the page and hit **"Preview"** to see how it looks. ( You could specify the template name, in this case I used `Uix Page Builder Template`.)

> You could create Uix Page Builder template file (from the directory **"/wp-content/plugins/uix-page-builder/theme_templates/page-uix_page_builder.php"** ) in your templates directory.

You will find **"Uix Page Builder Attributes"** settings in a meta box in your WordPress backend when you create a new page or when you are editing an existing one. This box is usually directly above the "Publish" meta box.
