== Installation ==

1. After activating your theme, you can see a prompt pointed out as absolutely critical. Go to "Appearance -> Install Plugins".
Or, upload the plugin to wordpress, Activate it. (Access the path (/wp-content/plugins/) And upload files there.)


2. Create a new WordPress file or edit an existing one. Just make sure to select this new created template file as the "Template" for this page from the "Attributes" section. Enter page title like "Custom One Page". Save the page and hit "Preview" to see how it looks. ( You could specify the template name, in this case I used **"Uix Page Builder Template"**. )


> You could create Uix Page Builder template file (from the directory **"/wp-content/plugins/uix-page-builder/theme_templates/page-uix_page_builder.php"** ) in your templates directory.


You will find **"Uix Page Builder Attributes"** settings in a meta box in your WordPress backend when you create a new page or when you are editing an existing one. This box is usually directly above the "Publish" meta box.
	

3. (Optional) Handles builder controls of backend template usage so that we can use our own templates instead of the plugin.

  Backend templates are in the <strong>"uix-page-builder-sections"</strong> folder. Includes custom "css, js, php" files. If you want to custom your builder controls of backend for your theme, then just copy them from the directory  <strong>"/wp-content/plugins/uix-page-builder/uix-page-builder-sections/"</strong> to your theme directory  <strong>"/wp-content/themes/{your-theme}/"</strong>.
